# What

Full-stack boilerplate to create full-stack applications using NestJS in the server, Vue in the front-end, and TypeScript as language. Includes config files to help to use it the repo in VSCode (higly recommended).

# How

back-end and front-end are just part of a lerna package, to keep isolated (and easily managed) both aspects of the project. There is a few configurations in each side to keep all working together (like the SPA module for NestJS).

# Why

As full-stack developer, I'm tired of fighting with Eslint, Babel, tsconfig's and more, I just want to prototype fast. NestJS it's great, Vue too, and with TypeScript together are awesome.
